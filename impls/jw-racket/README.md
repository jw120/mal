* Some error checking but rely on underlying racket to catch most invalid arguments

* Not implemented - meta data for lists/vectors/hash-maps/atoms (just done for functions)

* Defined a nil object. In Racket we have null which is the empty list and #f. Mal has '() and nil and #f all different.

* Does not save readline history file

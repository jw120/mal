## TODO

* Distinguish EOF from a comment in reader (eof value?)

* Defined a nil object. In Racket we have null which is the empty list and #f. Mal has '() and nil and #f all different.

* Readline history file
* Not error checking agruments - rely on racket exceptions
* Contracts on class methods? Contracts on other provides?

## Notes

* Using racket as a normal implementation (later try translating mal to racket with #lang)
